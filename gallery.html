Yaa Asantewaa was the queen mother of Ejisu in the Ashanti Empire, now part of modern Ghana. She was born in 1840 in Besease, Central Ghana, the eldest of two children. When her brother who was king died, she nominated her grandson as the king, but when the British empire came, they exiled him along with other members of the Ashanti government. The British governor of the Gold coast demanded to have the “Golden stool” a dynastic symbol of the Ashanti Empire, as a sign of surrender to the British colony. But at that time, Queen Asantewaa was the Gatekeeper of the Golden stool.</p>
